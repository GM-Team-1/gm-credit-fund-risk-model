GEOGRAPHIC HEATMAP LIMITATIONS REPORT
====================================

COVERAGE GAPS:
- Missing 0 US states: []
- 0 states with <10 companies: []
- 6 states with <50 companies (less reliable): ['ak', 'ms', 'nd', 'sd', 'wv', 'wy']

DATA QUALITY ISSUES:
- State coverage: 100.0% of US companies
- City data incomplete: 97.2% have coordinates
- Success rate threshold: funding_total_usd < $1M = under-capitalized
- Bias toward tech hubs: CA, NY, TX represent 0.5% of data

METHODOLOGICAL NOTES:
- Under-capitalization definition: Total funding < $1,000,000
- Success rate calculation: 1 - under_capitalization_rate  
- Age calculation: 2025 - founded_year
- Risk categories: Low(<30%), Medium(30-50%), High(50-70%), Very High(>70%)
- Size categories: Small(<50), Medium(50-200), Large(200-1000), Very Large(>1000)

DASHBOARD READINESS:
- State-level startup counts: 52 states
- State-level success rates: Range (np.float64(0.19), np.float64(0.52))
- State-level under-cap concentrations: Range (np.float64(0.48), np.float64(0.81))
- Visualization categories: Risk & Size tiers created
- Geographic coverage validation: 100.0% reliable
