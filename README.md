CFRM to evaluate under-capitalized startups for G&M

## Description
The G&M Credit Fund Risk Model (CFRM) is a machine learning project designed to evaluate early-stage, under-capitalized startups in the U.S., which currently receive less than 2% of venture capital. Investors face high uncertainty when funding these teams, as returns are not guaranteed within a given timeframe. This project seeks to address two core questions: can we estimate the risk of investment in a startup, and can we design a set of risk profiles.
